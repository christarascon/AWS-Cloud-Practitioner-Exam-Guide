The **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** exam is intended for individuals who can effectively demonstrate overall knowledge of the AWS Cloud, independent of a specific job role. The exam validates a candidate’s ability to complete the following tasks:

- Explain the value of the AWS Cloud.
- Understand and explain the AWS shared responsibility model.
- Understand security best practices.
- Understand AWS Cloud costs, economics, and billing practices.
- Describe and position the core AWS services, including compute, network, database, and storage services.
- Identify AWS services for common use cases.

## Target Candidate Description

The target candidate has up to 6 months of exposure to AWS Cloud design, implementation, and/or operations. This certification is ideal for candidates who are from non-IT backgrounds. These candidates might be in the early stages of pursuing an AWS Cloud career or might work with people in AWS Cloud roles.

### Recommended AWS Knowledge

The target candidate should have AWS knowledge in the following areas:

- AWS Cloud concepts
- Security and compliance in the AWS Cloud
- Core AWS services
- Economics of the AWS Cloud

### Job Tasks that are Out of Scope for the Target Candidate

The following list contains job tasks that the target candidate is not expected to be able to perform. This list is non-exhaustive. These tasks are out of scope for the exam:

- Coding
- Cloud architecture design
- Troubleshooting
- Implementation
- Load and performance testing

Refer to **Appendix A** for a list of technologies and concepts that might appear on the exam, a list of in-scope AWS services and features, and a list of out-of-scope AWS services and features.

## Exam Content

### Response Types

There are two types of questions on the exam:

- **Multiple choice**: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors)
- **Multiple response**: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options

Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose. Distractors are generally plausible responses that match the content area.

Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. The exam includes 50 questions that affect your score.

### Unscored Content

The exam includes 15 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects information about performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these questions for future use as scored questions. These unscored questions are not identified on the exam.

## Exam Results

The **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** exam has a pass or fail designation. The exam is scored against a minimum standard established by AWS professionals who follow certification industry best practices and guidelines.

Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The minimum passing score is 700. Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole and whether you passed. Scaled scoring models help equate scores across multiple exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty levels.

Your score report could contain a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to achieve a passing score in each section. You need to pass only the overall exam.

Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than others. The table of classifications contains general information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when you interpret section-level feedback.

## Content Outline

This CLF-C02 exam guide includes weightings, content domains, and task statements for the exam. Refer to **Appendix B** for a comparison of the previous version (CLF-C01) and current version (CLF-C02) of the exam.
